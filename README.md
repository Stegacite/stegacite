### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Stegacite/stegacite** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

"Stegacite" is a means to translate base64, such as would be used with a URL shortener, to English words.  
It is NOT a program and it is NOT a method of encryption or sending secret codes.  
Think of it as a means of complying with social media Terms and Conditions, or a CAPTCHA for social media moderators.
For example, the New York Post recently published an article that was banned from Facebook and Twitter.
People could not send this link because the companies didn't like it and reinterpreted their policies.
TinyURL was able to translate the URL to an 8-digit base64 code ( y5zr43pm ) for me just now.
Looking up y5, zr, 43, and pm on the enclosed table translates this to "geek pass hinky unbelievable".
However, every word in the table starts with a different four letters - ONLY those count.
So you could write "geeky passion hinkers unbelief" and the reader would still look up the first four letters only.
Will social media ban posts of those four words?  It's conceivable.
But then you can say "Our team is up by 3 so far cups parole federal unauthorized".
The last 4 words are down 3 from the real lookup, so if the reader goes up 3 he gets them.
The result from the 4 words is NOT actually a link - you have to assume it's on TinyURL because they're the first shortener.
Maybe you could put the word "tiny" somewhere in your post to make it ultra clear, or "bit" if it's bit.ly.
The goal is to make it possible to share information in a way that is complex, obscure, making sense to the human reader.
The social media thinks a bad post is a billion times more bad than a good post is good, and they want a machine
that can read a billion posts they don't think are worth reading.  Can they do that if people share links like this?
If someone posts four words that sound odd on social media - maybe he is giving you a way to find a source.  Who knows?
The table shown here is not MEANT to be unique.  I've put it on the table in a spiral to avoid "lock-in"...
yes, there is a simpler way to arrange it with an uninspired alphabetical order - DO that if you want, or something else.
Stegacite is meant to be a broad idea for a language that evolves and changes as need be to help people stay out of trouble.
The scheme can be modified to send whole bytes by capitalizing or otherwise marking the first 4 letters to share 4 extra bits
(two letters of base64 = 12 bits, two bytes = 16 bits).  This is less subtle but you can send an IP4 address as 2 words.
Using raw IP or unique tags that can be searched for is a means to make do when the link shorteners are closed down.

The word list in this initial version was casually censored but not everything that might stand out to social media has been found.
Remember you can change any part of the word after the first 4 letters!  But more revision is needed.  There are MANY unused words.

The list is heavy on the most common words because the first 14000 words in https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists
for TV scripts were used.  These were heavily revised, with most proper names removed and only one word with a given first 4 letters
can be used in the table.

An easy way to use the example table provided here is to open it in LibreOffice and search for the words you need to find.
As I used it the letter on top comes first and the letter on the side second for each pair.
You CAN automate this - even I can write this as a tiny program - but I want it to be extremely clear that this is an IDEA, not a PROGRAM.
So I am not planning to develop this as a program in this repository.  I *will* happily reference anyone who does code it.
I provide the PDF because this is meant to be usable even if/when the companies that own the world decide that people cannot run
software they write themselves or which doesn't have a purpose they find necessary.  It is NOT hard to do this by hand.
But please, go ahead and code it.  That's what the CSV version is meant for.
